The Future Engineers category of WRO 2025 tests how well teams can design and program a fully autonomous robot vehicle. Teams compete in two main challenges: Open Challenge and Obstacle Challenge.

Open Challenge

The robot must drive around the racetrack without any traffic signs or external help. It must:

Stay inside the track

Drive smoothly around curves and straights

Use sensors and good programming to stay controlled

This challenge tests basic autonomous driving skills, including stability, sensor accuracy, and reliable movement.

Obstacle Challenge

In this challenge, objects are placed on the track, and the robot must detect and avoid them. The robot must:

Sense obstacles

Change direction

Avoid collisions

Return to the correct path

This tests obstacle detection, decision-making, path planning, and reaction speed, similar to real self-driving cars.

Overall

Teams complete at least four rounds (two Open and two Obstacle), with random driving directions and track layouts. Together, the two challenges evaluate how well the robot can navigate independently and handle unpredictable situations — the core skills of real self-driving technology.

Our robot is built from the Zmrobo intelligence storm kit. it consists of a chassis with dummy wheels in the front and a rear wheels controlled by a motor servo, which uses an ultrasonic sensor and a camera from the kit, programmed in the zmrobo programminhg website.

we chose a rear-wheel and drivetrain for our robot.
PROS
Good acceleration on straight tracks
- Simple for differential steering robots
- CONS
- Less traction on narrow or slippery surfaces
- Can fishtail during sharp turns
  Best for WRO
Wide Open Challenge tracks where speed matters

Our chassis is made of the zmrobo kit which uses legos. these have joints where sensors and cameras can be attached easily. we used it because it is lightweight, easier to attach sensors and is stable.

we are team Technonots aka the tech divas. we consists of jessica, naomi , elvita and chigaemezu. we are an all-girls team and are a mission to fabulously incorporate technology and prove that girls can do anything!

we designed our robot, pzazz chinedu, to score maximum points with a light chassis and an overall simple mechanical build. we wanted to make sure the robot easy to program and fix errors if encountered.

Pzazz consists of a rear wheels controlled by a motor and dummy wheels controlled by a servo motor. it uses a motor and a servo motor. it has a camera and a ultrasonic sensor and a colour sensor( which we have tried to use) the robot uses the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles from a range of 10-15cm and will turn away from the obtscale(the wall) in the open challnege. for the obstacle challenge the robot uses a camera to detect the blocks and their respective colours.(it aslo serves as a colour sensor)

PRIMARY CONTROLLER: E6 RCU

we use an ackermann style steering system.
Front wheels turn like a car; rear wheels roll freely.

PROS
- Smooth turns
- Realistic car motion
- CONS
- 
- Cannot turn in place
- Needs more space for sharp corners
- 
- BEST for WRO
Wide tracks; can be tricky in narrow Obstacle Challenge

we use the standard rubber wheels

Smooth or lightly treaded rubber tires
PROS
- Good grip on smooth surfaces
- Affordable and widely available
  
- CONS
- Less effective on slippery surfaces
- Can slip on narrow paths if too fast
  
  Best for WRO
Most Open Challenge and Obstacle Challenge robots

we simply used the zmrobo intelligence storm kit to build our robot. the ZMROB3 program was used to compile the codes and a USB cord was used to upload the codes to the robot.

We tested if the robot was able to adjust and go round three laps and without going out of the map and hitting the wall. we learnt we made some mistakes in the code and the mechanical structure and we had to remove the colour sensor as it was malfunctioning. we made those mistakes because it was our first time using that programmming website and had to master using it. we were also quite inexperienced when it came to programming and building. we also started late to start working on our robot.

At first the robot went out of the map and hitted the walls but later on it was able to go round three laps and most adjust itself when it is too close to the obstacles(wall) automatically.
