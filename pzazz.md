The Future Engineers category of WRO 2025 tests how well teams can design and program a fully autonomous robot vehicle. 
Teams compete in two main challenges: Open Challenge and Obstacle Challenge.

Open Challenge

The robot must drive around the racetrack without any traffic signs or external help.
It must:

Stay inside the track

Drive smoothly around curves and straights

Use sensors and good programming to stay controlled

This challenge tests basic autonomous driving skills, including stability, sensor accuracy, and reliable movement.

Obstacle Challenge

In this challenge, objects are placed on the track, and the robot must detect and avoid them.
The robot must:

Sense obstacles

Change direction

Avoid collisions

Return to the correct path

This tests obstacle detection, decision-making, path planning, and reaction speed, similar to real self-driving cars.

Overall

Teams complete at least four rounds (two Open and two Obstacle), with random driving directions and track layouts.
Together, the two challenges evaluate how well the robot can navigate independently and handle unpredictable situations — the core skills of real self-driving technology.

Our robot is built from the Zmrobo intelligence storm kit. it consists of a chassis with dummy wheels in the front and a
rear wheels controlled by a motor servo, which uses an ultrasonic sensor and a camera from the kit, programmed in the zmrobo programminhg website.

we are team Technonots aka the tech divas. we consists of jessica, naomi , elvita and chigaemezu. we are an all-girls team and are a mission to fabulously incorporate technology 
and prove that girls can do anything!
